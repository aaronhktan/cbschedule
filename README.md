## What is this?

It's a Pebble app for checking what day of the cycle is at Colonel By. You can set your own schedule via the Pebble app.

## Features

This app allows you to customize your schedule, notifies you from the Timeline when and where your next class is, and all in a simple to use interface.

## How to use?

First, set up your schedule in the app in order to have it display in the main window.

When that's done, the main window shows what day it is (or the next day, if it's after school or not a school day). It also shows the current period. Pressing the select button allows you to view your schedule; the current period is highlighted.

## Future plans?

- Maintenance; additional features as they pop into my head.
