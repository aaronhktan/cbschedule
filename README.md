# CB Schedule Manager

## What is this?

It's a Pebble app for checking what day of the cycle is at Colonel By. You can set your own schedule via the Pebble app.

## How to use?

First, set up your schedule in the app in order to have it display in the main window.

When that's done, the main window shows what day it is (or the next day, if it's after school or not a school day). It also shows the current period. Pressing the select button allows you to view your schedule; the current period is highlighted.

## Future plans?

- Perhaps be able to see one other friend's schedule, so they don't get lost
- Make it work on Pebble Round and new Pebbles

## Completed List
